![Skeleton Tracker Screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/Mn9NCj8R/Screenshot-2025-11-24-140450.png)

Real-time skeleton tracker using your PC webcam (phone optional). It detects head, neck, torso, arms, hands, legs, and feet, drawing connected cyan lines and red landmarks. Fully browser-based, with selectable webcams, smooth tracking, and lightweight performance.

The tracker provides real-time skeleton detection directly in the browser, showing red landmarks with cyan lines connecting joints. You can select any connected PC webcam, and optionally use a phone camera via virtual webcam or IP camera. It is lightweight, easy to run, and requires no extra hardware.

This is fully Markdown-compatible and keeps headings for **Installation**, **Usage**, **File Structure**, **Dependencies**, **Screenshots**, and **License**, while the rest is written as normal flowing text.  

I can also **add a short “Live Demo” section** so people can try it instantly in the browser if you want. Do you want me to add that?
